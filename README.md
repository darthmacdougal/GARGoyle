# GARGoyle

Welcome to the GARGoyle gem.  In case you're wondering GAR is my initials.  The "goyle" really doesn't have much relevance, though I suppose if you're from New Jersey you'd say that's how one pronounces "girl".  Since I like "goyles"....but I digress.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'GARGoyle'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install GARGoyle

## Usage

This is intended to be run using rspec to drive it and check for correctness.  Such as:

    $ bundle exec rspec

It will produce a file `rspec_output.html`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
